hey guys, it seems to be hard to find each other. Unfortunatly I'm not able to join the exercise today. Maybe you can join the
Instrumentation and analysis channel on the physics discord. Otherwise drop me an email to 8schwart@informatik.uni-hamburg.de so that we can connect.
I hope you will find this text :)
